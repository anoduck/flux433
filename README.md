> Python script to import rtl_433 json files into influxdb.

## Intro

This project began life as [rtl433_influx](https://github.com/azrdev/rtl433_influx), was upgraded from InfluxDB v1.x to Influxdb v2.x. If I had known what a pain it would be to make this jump in versions, I never wouild have done it. But, being me, I couldn't stop until it was working. 

The purpose of this project is the creation of a repository of decoded rtl_433 captures, documenting when they were captured, how many times they were seen, and provide a means to catalog unidentified captures for further analysis.

Another planned feature is a continual query that will work towards removal of duplicate entries, while increasing the count of how many times the capture was seen.

## Install

```sh
poetry install
```

## Usage

I have never quite understood why some developers have relied on command line flags and arguments to configure their projects when it was not necessary, so as usual I have allowed some of the configuration to occur via a configuration file. As usual with some of my projects, an empty configuration file is created for the user when first run.

### Configuration File

The spec for the configuration file is as follows:

```ini
# Organization configured in influxdb
org = string(default='replace with influxdb organization')

# API token generated by influxdb for organization
api = string(default='replace with generated API token')Options = parse(options, dest="Options")

# Bucket name for use in influxdb
bucket = string(default='replace with bucket name')

# Watch for new files?
watch = boolean(default=False)

# Remove files when processed?
remove = boolean(default=False)

# Path to Dir of JSON files or Json File
path = string(default='~/Sandbox/ISM-Research')

# Log level
log_level = string(default='INFO')

# Log file
log_file = string(default='flux433.log')
```

### CLI arguments

As of this moment, the only flag that you should be concerned with is the `--path` flag. The other flag, `--test`, was for testing purposes, and will be removed in the future.

```sh
poetry run python flux433/start.py --path <path-to-dir or json-file>
```
